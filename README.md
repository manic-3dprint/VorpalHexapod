# VorpalHexapodHuaDuino
Arduino code for both the Vorpal Hexapod and Vorpal Hexapod Gamepad using [HuaDuino](https://www.ebay.com/itm/312249230239). 

This is the Arduino IDE code for the current version of the Vorpal Hexapod Project.

HuaDuino is Arduino Nano compatible with enhanced features. It integrates everything on a single PCB. It's a lot easier for people to make a bot. Embedded battery charging circuit, battery charging is more convenient.

SOURCING THE ELECTRONICS
------------------------
You are welcome to source all the parts yourself, but we respectfully ask you to consider buying some or all of the parts from our store:
http://store.vorpalrobotics.com

Buying our kits cuts at least 1.5 to 2 hours off the assembly time because we give you all the electronics pre-soldered, bluetooth modules are pre-configured to pair with each other automagically, and of course you know you're getting all compatible parts that work with the 3D models perfectly.

We have both kits and also each part individually so you can pick and choose what you source yourself and what you source through our store.
